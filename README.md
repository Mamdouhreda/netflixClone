# Netflix Clone

## Overview

This project is a clone of the popular streaming platform, Netflix. It's built using React for the frontend, Firebase for authentication and data storage, and Tailwind CSS for styling. While it doesn't offer the full functionality of Netflix (such as video streaming), it mimics the user interface and experience to provide a similar look and feel.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign up, sign in, and sign out functionality via Firebase authentication.
- **Browse Page:** Upon successful login, users can see a range of movie/series categories similar to the original Netflix.
- **Movie/Series Information:** Hovering over a movie or series thumbnail displays a brief synopsis of the selected title.
- **Search:** Users can search for specific movies or series.
- **Likes:** Users can add movies or series to their 'liked' list and view them later.

## Technologies

- **React:** Utilizing functional components and hooks, React serves as the backbone of the frontend.
- **Firebase:** User data and 'liked' movies/series data are stored in Firebase Firestore, providing a real-time database solution. The application is also deployed through Firebase.
- **Tailwind CSS:** This utility-first CSS framework offers an efficient, responsive design system, enabling us to create a user interface that closely resembles Netflix.
- **React-Router:** Handles page routing within the application.
